# Due to a combination of factors there's not a good unified answer to the
# qustion "How do I find SDL2 in CMake."  Ideally one just does
# find_package(SDL2) and either has the sdl2-config.cmake in the magic location
# or will point SDL2_DIR to the directory containing it.
#
# But not only are many people not aware of how this works, the SDL subprojects
# don't always follow the convention. We'd really like to use imported targets,
# we'd like to also support SDL 1.2, and we can just in general do more to make
# this seamless.
